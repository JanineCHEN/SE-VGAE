SE-VGAE: Unsupervised Disentangled Representation Learning for Interpretable Architectural Layout Design Graph Generation

Official code and instructions for [**"SE-VGAE: Unsupervised Disentangled Representation Learning for Interpretable Architectural Layout Design Graph Generation"**](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.17418v1)

# Introduction
This project introduces an unsupervised disentangled representation learning framework, Style-based Edge-augmented Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (SE-VGAE), aiming to generate architectural layout in the form of attributed adjacency multi-graphs while prioritizing representation disentanglement. The framework is designed with three alternative pipelines, each integrating a transformer-based edge-augmented encoder, a latent space disentanglement module, and a style-based decoder. These components collectively facilitate the decomposition of latent factors influencing architectural layout graph generation, enhancing generation fidelity and diversity.

# Environment
- Linux
- [Pytorch 1.8.1+cu113](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#linux-and-windows-48)
- CUDA-supported GPU with at least 24 GB memory size is required for training.
